# fail with a 500 when the string exceeds a certain length (at least on OS X)

# So, in case of a 500 return, we check for a proper body and assume
# that the failure was graceful and not a crash.

# The alternative would be to expand a env var under our control in .htacess
# for this test, so that the outcome is not depending on the env of the person
# starting the test.
